# Project-Corona
This my Project Corona it is based on Machine Learning Classification Algorithm which is KNN Algorithm.
Normally Corona virus becomes dangerous after 5-6 days if not properly treated it severely affects the lungs of an individual.
So the most common symptoms is Fever,DryCough and Tiredness.Therefore I have noted down the fever,no of times an individual coughs in the particular day and how many hours he is on the bed resting of some about 17 patients and judged by a doctor if he is in danger or in safe state then used KNN algorithm to predict the same.
